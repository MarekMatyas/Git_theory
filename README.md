## Version control 

Version control is a system that manages changes to documents, software code, or other types of files over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project, keep track of changes, revert to earlier versions, and merge changes made by different contributors. Version control systems provide a history of changes, including who made them and when, making it easier to understand the evolution of a project and to diagnose and fix problems.

## Git

Git is a popular distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. 
Git allows multiple developers ot work on the same codebase simlutaneously and track their changes independently.

It also supports branching and merging, which enables developers to experiment with different approaches to coding and then integrate their changes back into the main codebase.
